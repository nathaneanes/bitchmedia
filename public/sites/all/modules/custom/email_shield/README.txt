This version of email shield based on the original reroute_email by

Khalid Baheyeldin and http://2bits.com

Description
-----------
This module intercepts all outgoing emails from a Drupal site and
reroutes them to a predefined configurable email address.

This is useful in case where you do not want email sent from a Drupal
site to reach the users. For example, if you copy a live site to a test
site for the purpose of development, and you do not want any email sent
to real users of the original site. Or you want to check the emails sent
for uniform formatting, footers, ...etc.
