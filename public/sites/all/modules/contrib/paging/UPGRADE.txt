Upgrade notes:
===============

The upgrade path from Drupal 6 Paging module to Drupal 7 is underway, but it is not done yet. For now, this file will serve as documentation between the differences between the D6 and D7 versions of the modules.


Unsupported Features in D7:
----------------------------
Paging separator sting per content type.
- in D7 one paging separator string will be set for the whole site.
  - Configuration of this separator will be moved to the filter settings.
- Page names will not be configurable.


Upgrading from D6 to D7:
-------------------------
- Old separators will continue to work, as in D6.
  - After you choose a site-wide paging separator, node_save will parse and update any existing content to use the new separator.
- Page names entered in D6 will be ignored.
